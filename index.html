      <p>This is a prototype I made to try and see if I could successfully reverse engineer some of my favorite game's gameplay.</p>

<p>The gameplay style is from Capcom's MegaMan Battle Network series and has an added touch of MOBA style combat. Matches are 1v1 and there are two ways to play, either Player vs Player or Player vs CPU. Each player has a 9x9 grid they can move around on and have 4 abilities at their disposal, each on a cooldown timer. The first player whose health reaches 0 loses. </p>

<p> Watch a demo of it here:</p>
