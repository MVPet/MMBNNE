<p>This project was done to test out what was possible with Unity2D (C#) and as a tool for learning Unity before I began the Buoyancy project at URI.</p>

<p>The goal was to combine Capcom's Battle Network gameplay with MOBA elements. I decided the best way to combine them was to keep the 3x3 grid for each player to move about on and keep the default mega buster as the always available attack. I replaced the 20-chip deck with 4 abilities that would go on a cooldown after they were used. Instead of having a base that had to be destroyed, I preferred the deathmatch style where the last player alive wins. To provide a decent balance I set each players health to 250.</p>

<p>Content that had to be cut was additional characters to play as and additional arena styles. This was never included because I did not have enough time before the Buoyancy project began to implement them, however, the framework is in place for it.</p>

<p>Total development time is ~25 hours.</p>
