This is a personal project I made to test out and become accustomed to Unity.

It is in an alpha state and was meant to be a learning tool than a large full fledged game.

The gameplay style is from Capcom's Mega Man Battle Network series and has an added touch of DOTA. Matches are 1v1 with two human players or one human vs one CPU. Each player has a 9x9 grid they can move around on and have 4 abilities at their disposal. The first player whose health reaches 0 loses.
