<p>This is the first prototype and game I have made. This was used to learn the general ins and outs of game and gameplay development. I decided on using the gameplay from Capcom's Mega Man Battle Network series due to my enjoyment and knowledge of the gameplay and AI mechanics.</p>

<h3><p align="center">The Prototype</p></h3>

<p>The prototype contains 2 game modes, Player Vs Player and Vs CPU. The gameplay is a 1v1 battle where each character has a 3x3 grid of squares to move on. The Player Character has a basic attack that can be rapid fired or charged to do more damage. Additionally, there are 4 abilities that when used, will go on cooldown.<br>
<br>
The AI and Players actions have been replicated as close to the source as possible. The Player can only move to adjacent squares, whereas the AI will be constantly teleporting between the 9 squares in its field. This is the only "advantage" the AI has over the player; Charge Shots and the 4 abilities function the same way between the Player and the AI.</p>
